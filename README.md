# SBP-SAT_3D

## High Level Goal:
Repo to keep track of 3D SBP-SAT Work for eventual use in the Thrase.jl project from Prof. Brittany Erickson.

## Project Description:
Current sandbox for development of Thrase project with 3D SBP-SAT methods. Implementing rough code to cover the SEAS BP5 benchmark problem.

## Current Progress:
As of 9-5-2025
- BP5 Driver and odefun run, but solutions are not converging for test parameter inputs
- Some testing of different index and machinery operators done

## TO-DO:
- [ ] Implement plotting functions for slip
- [ ] Diagnose the errors in BP5 math
- [ ] Implement further multithread, gpu, and other performance optimizations
- [ ] Automate further Unit Testing for metric, operator, and other identities in the papers

## Papers:
